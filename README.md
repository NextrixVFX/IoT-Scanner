# How it works
- This generates near-accurate ip's and scans for ports IoT devices usually use
- saves any ip's found paired with a port to a text file

# How to use
- Set your timeout, threads, and ip's to generate in the IoTScanner params. (line 43)
- Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- Run "python main.py"
